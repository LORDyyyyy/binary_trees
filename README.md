## Introduction

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes, where each node can have at most two children. They are widely used in computer science and can be employed for various applications, such as searching, sorting, and organizing data efficiently.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of binary tree operations implemented in C, allowing users to manipulate and perform common tasks on binary trees.

## Installation

To use this code in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-tree-code-project.git
   ```

2. Include the necessary header files in your C source files:

   ```c
   #include "binary_trees.h"
   ```

3. Compile your source files along with the provided source files:

   ```shell
   gcc your_file.c binary_trees/*.c -o your_binary_file
   ```

4. Link against the required libraries if needed.

## Usage

To use the binary tree operations provided by this project, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a binary tree:

   ```c
   binary_tree_t *root = binary_tree_node(NULL, 10);
   ```

2. Perform various operations on the binary tree, such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, traversing the tree, etc.

   ```c
   binary_tree_insert_left(root, 20);
   binary_tree_insert_right(root, 30);
   binary_tree_preorder(root, print_node_value);
   binary_tree_delete(root);
   ```

3. Customize the code provided to suit your specific needs or integrate it into your existing projects.

## File Descriptions

The project consists of the following files:

1. binary_tree_node.c: Implements the creation of a binary tree node.
2. binary_tree_insert_left.c: Inserts a node as the left child of another node.
3. binary_tree_insert_right.c: Inserts a node as the right child of another node.
4. binary_tree_delete.c: Deletes an entire binary tree.
5. binary_tree_is_leaf.c: Checks if a node is a leaf.
6. binary_tree_is_root.c: Checks if a node is a root.
7. binary_tree_inorder.c: Performs in-order traversal on a binary tree.
8. binary_tree_preorder.c: Performs pre-order traversal on a binary tree.
9. binary_tree_postorder.c: Performs post-order traversal on a binary tree.
   ...
   (list the remaining files and provide a brief description of each)
